## Algorithm Used
The AI uses a simple frequency-based prediction algorithm:
- It tracks the player's move history. 📋
- If fewer than 3 moves have been made, the AI chooses randomly. 🎲
- Otherwise, it predicts the player's most frequent move and selects the move that beats it. 🧠
- This heuristic approach allows the AI to adapt to the player's tendencies and improve its chances of winning. 🚀
