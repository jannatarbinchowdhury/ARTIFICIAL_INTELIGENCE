## 🧠 How Algorithms Work

### 🏔️ Hill Climbing

A greedy local search that moves to the best neighboring state. Continues until reaching a local optimum where no neighbor is better than the current state. Simple but can get stuck in local maxima.

### 🔦 Beam Search

Systematic search that maintains a fixed number of best nodes (beam width) at each level. Combines breadth-first exploration with heuristic pruning to balance completeness and efficiency.

- Machine Learning - gradient ascent/descent  
- Scheduling - task assignment optimization  
- Network Configuration - parameter tuning  
- Game AI - position evaluation and improvement  
- Resource Allocation - local optimization  

### 🔦 Beam Search Applications

- Natural Language Processing - speech recognition, translation

## ⚡ Complexity Analysis

| Algorithm       | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Optimal? | Complete? | Memory Usage |
|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Hill Climbing 🏔️ | O(k × b)        | O(1)             | ❌ No    | ❌ No     | Very Low     |
| Beam Search 🔦   | O(b^d × log(β)) | O(β × d)         | ❌ No    | ❌ No     | Moderate     |

Legend:  
k = Number of steps to local optimum  
b = Branching factor  
d = Depth of search  
β = Beam width  
log(β) = Sorting cost for beam selection  

Characteristics:  
- Hill Climbing: Fast, memory-efficient, but incomplete  
- Beam Search: More thorough than hill climbing, tunable exploration

## 🛠️ Usage

### Basic Setup

```cpp
// Create search algorithms instance
SearchAlgorithms search;

// Define graph structure
search.graph = {
    {0, {1, 2, 3}},
    {1, {4}},
    {2, {}},
    {3, {5}},
    {4, {}},
    {5, {8}},
    {8, {}},
};

// Set heuristic values (lower is better - distance to goal)
search.heuristics = {
    {0, 6},  // Start node
    {1, 5},
    {2, 4},
    {3, 3},
    {4, 3},
    {5, 2},
    {8, 0},  // Goal node
};
```

### Running Algorithms

```cpp
// Hill Climbing Search
auto result = search.hill_climbing(0, 8);
if (!result.empty()) {
    cout << "Hill Climbing Path: ";
    for (auto node : result) cout << node << " ";
    cout << endl;
}

// Beam Search with different beam widths
result = search.beam_search(0, 8, 2);
if (!result.empty()) {
    cout << "Beam Search Path: ";
    for (auto node : result) cout << node << " ";
    cout << endl;
}

// Try different beam widths for comparison
search.beam_search(0, 8, 1);  // Greedy
search.beam_search(0, 8, 3);  // Broader search
```
