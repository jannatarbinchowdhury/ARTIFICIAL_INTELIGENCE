## 🧠 How Algorithms Work

### 🌊 Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Explores graph level by level using a queue. Visits all neighbors at current depth before moving to next depth level.

### 🏔️ Depth-First Search (DFS)

Explores as far as possible along each branch using recursion. Backtracks when no unvisited neighbors remain.

### 📏 Depth-Limited Search (DLS)

DFS with a depth constraint. Stops exploring beyond specified depth limit to avoid infinite paths.

### 🔄 Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)

Combines DFS's space efficiency with BFS's optimality. Performs DLS with increasing depth limits until target found.

### ↔️ Bidirectional Search (BDS)

Searches simultaneously from start and goal nodes. Terminates when frontiers meet, potentially reducing search space significantly.

## 🛠️ Usage

```cpp
// Create graph instance
Graph g;

// Add edges (undirected)
g.add_edges(3, 6);
g.add_edges(6, 0);
g.add_edges(6, 4);
g.add_edges(3, 9);
g.add_edges(9, 5);
g.add_edges(9, 7);

// Run algorithms
g.bfs(3);                          // BFS from node 3
g.dfs(3);                          // DFS from node 3
g.depth_limited_dfs(3, 4, 2);      // DLS: find 4 from 3, depth limit 2
g.ids(3, 7, 3);                    // IDS: find 7 from 3, max depth 3
g.bds(3, 7);                      // BDS: find path from 3 to 7
