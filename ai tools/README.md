## 🎥 AI-Created Video

**Tool Used:** InVideo AI  
**Purpose:** To create a 1+ minute video that blends **theoretical concepts** (course topics) with **practical lab work** (algorithms & games).

### ✅ Steps:
- **Outline Preparation**  
  Identified major topics: course intro, search algorithms, game-playing AI, lab projects.

- **InVideo AI Generator**  
  Used a pre-built template and entered rough bullet points directly (no full script).  
  InVideo's AI selected visuals, transitions, and pacing to match the structure.

- **Customization & Timing**  
  Edited visuals and on-screen text, and fine-tuned scene duration to keep it just over 1 minute.

- **Final Export**  
  Reviewed for clarity and flow.  
  Exported in **1080p** as `ai_course_overview.mp4`.

## 📊 AI-Generated Presentation Slides

**Tools Used:**
- **ChatGPT** (for original outline & structure)  
- **Gamma.app** (for AI slide creation & final editing)

### ✅ Steps:
- **Slide Outline via ChatGPT**  
  Requested a 10–12 slide breakdown covering AI theory and lab topics.

- **Gamma AI Slide Maker**  
  Pasted the outline into [Gamma.app](https://gamma.app)  
  Let Gamma generate slide structure, content, and visuals automatically.  
  Manually edited slides inside Gamma for clarity, visual flow, and layout.

- **Enhancements Included:**  
  - Consistent theme and layout  
  - Search tree diagrams & lab visuals  
  - Icons, images, and engaging transitions  
  - Final sections like “Future Plans” and “Conclusion”

- **Exported** as `.pptx` and `.pdf` versions directly from Gamma.
